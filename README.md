# git-chunkify

Alternative to Git Large File Storage (LFS)

A tool that splits large files into smaller 5MB chunks that can be uploaded to GitHub repo and merge them as needed.

e.g: You can store a large resource file in your project repo itself and that can be merged later during build generation.
